/*
  IMPORTANT NOTE:

  If you get errors on 'ng serve' like eg.

    ERROR in ../Documents/VCE/VPAtlas/vpAtlas-ng7-ui/src/main.ts
    Module build failed (from ../Documents/VCE/VPAtlas/vpAtlas-ng7-ui/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js):
    Error: C:\Users\jloomis\Documents\VCE\VPAtlas\vpAtlas-ng7-ui\src\main.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation.
      Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.

  This is caused by path errors arising from your environment. On Windows 10, if
  you use a symbolic link to change directory to this application directory, it
  causes angular to fail to find the root directory, and it cannot locate main.ts
  and polyfills.ts. To resolve this, in your development terminal session, simply
  change directory explicitly, not via a simbolic link.
